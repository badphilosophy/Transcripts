Intro (Stephen Torrence): Bad Philosophy Episode 18, recorded on January 10, 2009.
STV: Hello every-welcome and one two, Bad Philosophy, yes, coming at you in the best audio configuration we have ever had on the show. We’re almost pro-casters.
MTL: Wahoo
KVN: Weee
STV: We have one fewer mikes than people, which is...
KVN: It’s a pretty good step up
STV: If you’ve been listening to this podcast for any length of time you know we’ve gone through multiple audio configurations and very few of them have worked, well. *laughs* We started out just recording on the omni- directional mike in my laptop which sounded ok but you could really tell that we were all just sitting around a laptop in a room. We made some attempts to do multiple microphones on different computers and tried; we bought a nice fancy mixer and had a bunch of debacles with that, and finally we’ve found a configuration that works
KVN: Almost
STV: I bit the bullet and bought myself a pretty nice XLR based headset so I can now use that with the mixer and we’ve discovered that there are multiple mikes in the DMS; here in the media library, that function properly.
MTL: 1.36 And that’s success right there
STV: That is success right there, I am happy about this, this is wonderful. We have on the show for her second time, Julie. Go ahead and introduce yourself, say a little more than you did last time.
JLI1:49: I’m Julie Meadows and I am on the show and in a couple of weeks I will be headed off to Korea so I’m gonna spend a little bit of time talking some BF with you guys before I take off.
STV2:00: That’s what we like to hear back, you know him, you love him, and you can’t get rid of him Kevin Saunders.
KVS2:10: Hey there, hi there, ho there.
STV2:12: Sweet. He’s wearing a “I have highly evolved skills” T-shirt showing the progression of mankind to ape to homo sapiens to rabid gamer. We’ve come a long way in 10,000 years. Finally on the show with his own microphone, a bit under the weather but no worse for wear, Matt Legler.
MTL2:32: That’s right hey guys I’m glad I’m here.
STV2:34: Just a short note on the microphone Matt, move it over here, so that when you turn your head you’re actually still facing into the microphone.
KVN2:44: That’s the problem with a uni-directional mike.
STV:2:47: That’s excellent. Ok. So Kevin came up with this rather brilliant idea for a promotion on the podcast.
KVN2:56: I’m a publicity whore.
STV: I mean, we really need to whore for some publicity right now. So, Kevin take it away
KVN3:04: Alright well I’ve mentioned Cory Doctorow on this podcast to not be a fan-boy. Because I am. And one of the things that we talked about that Cory does is release stuff on a creative commons license that are free for download that a free for anybody to have just whatever to do with what they want. Well, not to do anything that they want but like one of the things he encourages people to do is to release it under different formats. For all sorts of various readers, for Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town, there is actually a blog post on his website craphound.com about someone put that into a Palm OS and watch, there is a picture of his book on some guy’s wristwatch.
STV3:44: That’s fantastic.
KVN3:46: So he puts it out in pdf, html and plain text, all his books and then people can convert them to whatever forms they want and he lets them do this. Side-story, I live in Grapevine and Lubbick; I don’t live there very often but I go back there to see my family and have a good time, and every time I do it’s a 6 hour drive from Lubbock to Grapevine, Grapevine to Lubbock. So what I’ve got in the habit of doing is getting audiobooks and listening to them. And because I’m a poor college student, Cory Doctorow’s stuff is free and while you certainly should go out there and buy his stuff and I certainly will once I have a little more cash. I’m actually about to buy Little Brother because it’s so fantastic that I can’t live without having a hard-copy of it.
STV,MTL: *laugh*
KVN4:24: I’m getting off topic. 6 hour drive, audiobooks, Cory Doctorow’s books have been recorded by various people, sometimes Cory records them, sometimes other people record them. The one book of this that I have not gotten to is Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town because it hasn’t been in an audiobook format and that is the best time for me to like do Cory Doctorow, that’s 6 hours either way. On this most recent one I listened to, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, which is his first novel, it was released as a podcast by a guy with a podcast. He used it as part of his feed, and Cory was cool with it and he links to that on the Magic Kingdom website; not the Disney Magic Kingdom website, the Cory Doctorow website.
STV5:08: I’ve been to the Magic Kingdom and I’m pretty sure I didn’t see Cory Doctorow there.
KVN5:15: No. Craphound.com is his main site, and he’s also a poster or an editor or whatever on BoingBoing.net which is a pretty cool blog. But it (Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town) doesn’t have an audiobook format and for somebody who’s really started to embrace that especially with road trips and things like that I felt sad and I felt like I should give back to the Cory Doctorow community by recording Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town as sort of my payment for letting Cory Doctorow let me listen to all this stuff. I will probably be recording – its not broken up into chapters – but I’ll probably do like 30 minute segments of the book. I don’t know exactly how long that’s going to take, how many segments we are going to end up having. We are going to be releasing them on this feed. So if you are already subscribed to BF, you will also be getting Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town by Cory Doctorow in the near future. In addition to BF and all that other stuff. You don’t have to listen to it but its good stuff, I’m into the books and stuff and it’s also an enjoyable book. It’s not hard Sci-fi, well, it’s Sci-fi
STV6:22: It’s hard enough
KVN6:24: And its good stuff. Cory Doctorow’s stuff is very imaginative; this is a very imaginative book. Weird stuff exists and I don’t want to say too much because I’m going to be reading the book.
STV6:37: It’ll be good stuff. And the idea is that by putting this out there, it’ll bring people to BF.
KVN6:43: Oh yeah, definitely
STV6:44: In the process of listening to Cory Doctorow’s book on their feed they might happen to listen to some of the BF episodes and hopefully like them.
KVN6:53: I have no problem with whoring myself out if you want to call it that. It’s something that I’ve wanted to do and I now have a format to do it in via BF and it will benefit both Cory Doctorow fans and BF.
STV7:06: Pre-sinus-ly
KVN7:07 Which I just consider (Cory Doctorow fans) to be future BF fans.
STV7:11 Excellent. Well that sort of brings us around to our topic of the day which is Creative Commons/Copyright/ Statute of Limitations and *Kevin adds:* Public Domain. You mentioned Disney earlier and the Magic Kingdom and I have a particular beef with Disney because umm every time it seems that the Mickey Mouse trademark. Or whatever. Steamboat Willy comes up for renewal, or comes up for the point where the Copyright would expire, Disney launches a massive lobbying campaign in congress and ultimately ends up extending the copyright period for 15, 25, even 50 more years. They are actually considering pushing a bill that would extend the expiration time to 150 - absolutely ridiculous – beyond the lifetime time of Walt Disney.
KVN8:16: It’s not 150 years, its 150 years after death.
STV8:17: Oh, 150 years after the death of the original author.
KVN8:21: Yes, the current copyright stands its – I want to say seventy, maybe even one hundred years - probably seventy because we haven’t hit the hundred year mark since Steamboat Willy. It’s supposed to be that it lasts seventy years after the creator’s death (capitals on creator? - Ed). Originally it was death plus seven, which was the original – not the original copyright – but that was one of the first big ones. You die, your family can make money off that for seven years exclusively to help support that family – and seven years is a pretty substantial time to live off somebody else’s work – excuse me *SNEEZES*.
STV9:01: You sneezed!
MTL9:02: Bless you
KVN9:03: *Giggles* Thank-you Stephen.
STV9:06: I’m sorry; I just want to go off on a little tangent here.
RABBIT TRAIL: You sneezed
STV9:08: I have a beef with the whole, you know, “Bless you” thing. Did we talk about this on the last?
KVN9:12: We did, I don’t remember if it was on the ‘cast of after the ‘cast.
STV9:15: You know, saying “Bless you” comes from an archaic belief that if you sneezed that your soul was now vulnerable to the daemons stealing it away or something, so the Catholics would say “God Bless you” and it would scare the daemons away and they wouldn’t take your soul. For some reason it has persisted in our culture as the courteous thing to do whenever someone expels saliva from their mouth at 80mp/h (130km/h – Ed). I see it as no different from any other bodily function; yawning, blinking, farting, whatever. We don’t really have a courteous thing to say when someone blinks
MTL: Do you not feel exposed when you’re blinking though?
STV: I don’t
KVN: Side-note on blinking. I read this somewhere so it may or may not be true, but it makes a lot of sense. That when you blink, part of your brain shuts down for that period of time so you are not conscious of the fact that you are blinking, its involuntary. When you consciously sit here and go “blink, blink, blink” you’re aware of it because it’s a mental thing, you’re doing that. But when you unconsciously blink and its not part of something that you’re doing naturally, it happens all the time but you don’t notice it because it shuts down for that millisecond or whatever it is so you don’t actually miss anything. Your visual stream is not interrupted.
STV10:38: Ok, fascinating.
MTL10:40: Back to bless you.
STV10:42: Back to the sneezing thing. Julie, what do you think, do you think we should keep saying “bless you” every time somebody sneezes? Not even “God bless you” but just “bless you.”
JLI10:51: Its really strange to me and I’ve always found it really strange because I’ve heard that before that it is kind’ve an old tradition, but I don’t know, sometimes I think that I have to say it because otherwise the other person’s going to think that I’m rude or something.
STV11:04: Yeah, its rude if you don’t say it. Sometimes people will battle to be the first person who says “bless you”. They’ll say it like really soon after *sneeze* “bless you!”
MTL11:16: HA! Gotcha!
JLI11:17: Well if they sneeze again, do you say it again?
KVN11:18: I am a multiple-sneezer. Some people don’t know this about me, but I sneeze in two’s and three’s generally. At least two, sometimes three. I will sneeze and then someone will say “bless you,” and then I’ll sneeze again immediately afterwards and they’ll say “bless you” again, and by the time they get to the third sneeze they’re tired of blessing me!
STV11:35: Exactly. You only get two “bless you’s”
KVN11:36: You only get two.
MTL11:38: That’s what makes it awkward
JLI11:38: I think I’m always the awkward blesser, I’m like “should I say it, should I not” *laughter* “are they done sneezing yet, I’m just not sure.”
MTL11:47: See you’ve got to mix it up, after you say “bless you” like two times, then you get to the third and you say “oh, excuse you.” Mix it up.
JLI11:52: People sneeze sometimes and I’m like “goodness.”
STV11:55: By the third one it’s their fault; “oh, excuse you for inconveniencing me.”
MTL11:59: Well have you heard someone say that before “oh, excuse you.”
STV, JLI12:02: No
MTL12:04: You’ve never heard that? I heard people say that all the time.
KVN12:06: If someone burps you’re supposed to say “excuse me,” because its rude to burp – I think it’s fun but whatever.
STV12:15: Why doesn’t someone do the same thing when they sneeze? *atchoo* - “excuse me.”
KVN12:18: Well yeah, because its “excuse me for interrupting the conversation,” or whatever. You say “excuse me” when you burp, and I’ve seen some people who, if you burp and then you don’t say “excuse me” some people will be like “well excuse you!” Because you didn’t say it. I’m like well if the social setting were burping isn’t a faux-pas, I’m just sitting around having fun with my friends and I burp in front of them, so what? Anyway, back to the start of all this, the sneezing replacement. This is something that I want to get started like “thumbs-up for slurpies.” Was it my idea?
STV12:50: I think you came up with it, I don’t know.
KVN12:52: It was somebody’s idea.
STV12:54: Its related to American Sign Language.
KVN12:55: Oh that’s right, that’s where it came from.
STV12:57: When someone sneezes, you traditionally just sign “you sneezed.” It’s taken to mean “bless you” and then they say thank-you or whatever. But I think we should start doing it in English. So whenever someone sneezes you just say “you sneezed!”
KVN13:17: It’s not like it’s a negative thing, it’s just an acknowledgement.
STV13:19: Right!
MTL13:20: So it’s just like congratulations, you made it!
KVN13:24: It’s just like thumbs-up for slurpies
STV13:27: And then you’re different, and I like being oddly, quirkily different. Plus it eliminates that awkward thing. Then the whole sneezing thing, you’re not just saying what everyone else says, you’re kind-of just making it into a fun joking thing. “Why yes, I did sneeze.”
MTL13:42: It works multiple times.
JLI13:44: *sarcasm* I did not sneeze
KVN13:45: You’re lying! Its lies!
JLI13:48: I was expelling demons, ok?
STV13:51: Just doing my demon-hunting duties.
MTL13:56: That was a good little tangent there.
KVN13:58: It was
END RABBIT TRAIL: You sneezed
STV14:00: Anyway, back to public domain/copyright. Let’s get all philosophic on this. What a concept, bad philosophy. What do y’all think should be the period of time that should pass before a work goes public domain? Was the seven years right, should it be 50, should it be 150 years until someone can do whatever they want with your work?
KVN14:22: I’ll say something. The straight up answer is; I’m not really sure. I have this sort of battle in me because I’m a writer, I write things, and I hope to either have them published or my plays produced or whatever. So I want to get credit and I want to make money for my work. Growing up, I’ve been ingrained with the idea that that’s how you do it, you have to keep your copyright, you have to protect your copyright, and you have to fight for it. But then I look at someone like Cory Doctorow who’s making a living as a writer giving his books away. It’s this thing where I’m questioning what the purpose is. It’s one of those things where, ok; I release a play and I’ve seen how it works with books and novels because Cory Doctorow does that. If I have a play that I’ve written and I’ve produced, the way I make money off that is not by people buying the play, it’s by people putting it on and they pay me royalties for that. So it’s a very different situation in my mind that I haven’t quite figured out how to deal with yet. I could very easily release a play, public domain, creative commons, and say “you can perform it, you can’t change it, let me know when you’re doing it and attribute me appropriately.” That is one of the various creative commons licenses. I don’t know if the same situation exists with plays as with novels.
STV15:47: Well, it creates all sorts of complications. What is the initial intention of copyright. It’s to keep someone from taking what you have created and calling it their own. Or making money off it. Maybe this would be a good thing to bring up with Alex, Kevin’s friend who’s teaching English in Japan. I’ve seen pictures from over there of vending machines that have Pokémon, for instance, just on the machine. There’s no trademark thing, it’s not even anything to do with Pokémon. This is just the art that whoever designed the vending machine decided to adorn it with. It seems like the copyright laws are different over there. So you do end up having these situations where people will just say “oh that’s a cool company logo, I think I’ll put that on my thing-a-ma-bob that I’m making right here, I’ll put this on my device. Not give any sort of credit to the original source.” People do that. And folks are still making money. It doesn’t become an issue until the person that’s ripping you off is making significant money off your work. Nobody is ever going to make more money than Disney with Mickey Mouse. That is simply not ever going to be the case. But we should be able to use Mickey Mouse without having to pay Disney.
MTL17:20: What about the Happy Birthday song?
KVN17:24: Someone did a scholarly article investigating the copyright claims of Happy Birthday. Investigating these two sisters’ claim on it and apparently this guy makes a pretty good case that it actually is in the public domain.
MTL17:42: Really?
STV17:43: I would agree
KVN17:44: Using legal precedence and things like that, and that their copyright may not even be the first copyright on Happy Birthday.
STV17:54: Well that’s a good example, everybody sings the Happy Birthday song and it’s not like you’re thinking well, who owns this.
